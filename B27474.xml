            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <lg>
                  <l>A Noble Lord of high renown</l>
                  <l>Two daughters had; the eldest brown,</l>
                  <l>The youngst beautiful and fair.</l>
                  <l>By chance a noble Knight came there.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Her father said, kind fir, I have</l>
                  <l>Two daughters, which do you crave?</l>
                  <l>One that is beautiful, he cry'd,</l>
                  <l>The noble knight he then reply'd:</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>She's young she's beautiful and gay,</l>
                  <l>And is not to be giv'n away.</l>
                  <l>But as jewels are bought and sold,</l>
                  <l>She shall bring me her weight in gold.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The price I think you need not grudge,</l>
                  <l>Since I will freely give as much</l>
                  <l>With her one sister, if I can</l>
                  <l>Find out some other nobleman.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>With that bespoke the noble knight,</l>
                  <l>'d sooner have the beauty bright</l>
                  <l>At that vast rate, renowned lord.</l>
                  <l>Then then the other with a vast reward,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So then the bargain it was made,</l>
                  <l>But e'er the money could be paid,</l>
                  <l>He had it of a wealthy Jew,</l>
                  <l>The sum so large, the writings drew</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That if he fail'd, or miss'd the day,</l>
                  <l>So many ounces he should pay.</l>
                  <l>Of his own flesh, instead of gold,</l>
                  <l>All was agreed, the sum was told.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So he return'd immediately,</l>
                  <l>Unto the lord, where he did buy</l>
                  <l>His daughter fine, I do declare.</l>
                  <l>And paid him down the money there,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He bought her too, it was well known</l>
                  <l>Unto mankind she was his own.</l>
                  <l>By her a son he did enjoy.</l>
                  <l>A sweet and comely handsome boy,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>At length the time of pay drew near</l>
                  <l>When the knight did begin to fear;</l>
                  <l>He dreaded much the cruel Jew</l>
                  <l>Because the money it was dew.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>His lady ask'd him Why he griev'd?</l>
                  <l>He said, My jewel, I receiv'd</l>
                  <l>Such a sum of money of a Jew,</l>
                  <l>And now the money it is due,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And now the day of payment's come,</l>
                  <l>I'm sure I cannot raise the sum,</l>
                  <l>He'll have my flesh, weight for weight,</l>
                  <l>Which makes my grief and sorrow great.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Tush! never fear him, she reply'd</l>
                  <l>We'll cross the raging ocean wide</l>
                  <l>And so secure you from the fate,</l>
                  <l>To her request he yielded strait.</l>

                  <l>THEN having pass'd the raging seas;</l>
                  <l>They travel'd on, 'till by degrees</l>
                  <l>Unto the German court he came,</l>
                  <l>The knight his son, and comely dame.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Unto the Emperor he told</l>
                  <l>His story of the sum of gold,</l>
                  <l>That he had borrow'd of a Jew,</l>
                  <l>And that for fear of death he flew.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Emperor he did erect</l>
                  <l>A court for them and shew'd respect</l>
                  <l>Unto his guests, because they came</l>
                  <l>From BRITON, that blest land of fame.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>As here he lived in delight,</l>
                  <l>A Dutch lord told our English knight.</l>
                  <l>That he a ton of gold would lay,</l>
                  <l>He could enjoy his lady gay.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>From her the lord he was to bring</l>
                  <l>A rich and costly diamond-ring,</l>
                  <l>That was to prove and testify</l>
                  <l>How he did with his lady lie.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He tries, but never could obtain</l>
                  <l>Her favour but with high disdain;</l>
                  <l>She did abhor his base intent,</l>
                  <l>So to her chamber-maid he went.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And told her if she would but steal</l>
                  <l>Her lady's ring and to conceal</l>
                  <l>The same, and bring it to him strait,</l>
                  <l>She should enjoy a fine estate,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In hopes of such a fine reward</l>
                  <l>The ring she stole, then the Dutch lord</l>
                  <l>Did take it to the noble knight</l>
                  <l>Who almost swooned at the sight.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Home he goes to the lady strait</l>
                  <l>Meeting her at the palace gate,</l>
                  <l>He flung her headlong into the mote.</l>
                  <l>And left her there to sink or float.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Soon after that in cloaths of green,</l>
                  <l>She like a war like knight was seen,</l>
                  <l>And in most gallant gay deport</l>
                  <l>She rode unto the Emperor's court,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now when the Emperor beheld</l>
                  <l>Her brave deportment, he was fill'd</l>

                  <l>The Dutch lord came, seeming to fret</l>
                  <l>About the ring, seeming to fear,</l>
                  <l>How truth world make his shame appear</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And so it did, for soon they call</l>
                  <l>The maid, who on kees did fall,</l>
                  <l>Before the court and did confess</l>
                  <l>The Dutch lord's unworthiness,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The court reply'd, Is it so?</l>
                  <l>The lady too for ought we know,</l>
                  <l>May be alive, therefore we'll stay</l>
                  <l>The sentence till another day.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now the Dutch lord gave him a ton</l>
                  <l>Of Gold which he had justly won;</l>
                  <l>And so he did with shame and grief,</l>
                  <l>And thus the knight obtain'd relief.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Dutch lord to revenge the spite</l>
                  <l>Upon our noble English knight,</l>
                  <l>Did send a letter out of hand,</l>
                  <l>And so Jew did understand,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How he was in a German Court.</l>
                  <l>So here upon this good report,</l>
                  <l>The Jew he cross'd the ocean wide,</l>
                  <l>Resolving to be satisfied.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Soon as e'er he fix'd his eyes</l>
                  <l>Unto the knight, in wrath he cries.</l>
                  <l>Your hand and seal I pray behold:</l>
                  <l>Your flesh I'll have instead of gold.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Said the noble knight in green,</l>
                  <l>Sir, may not your articles be seen?</l>
                  <l>Yes, that they may reply'd the Jew,</l>
                  <l>And I resolve to have my due.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Lo then the knight began to read,</l>
                  <l>At length she said, I find indeed,</l>
                  <l>Nothing but flesh you are to have,</l>
                  <l>Answers the Jew, That's all I crave.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The poor distressed knight was brought,</l>
                  <l>The bloody-minded Jew he thought</l>
                  <l>That day to be revenged on him,</l>
                  <l>And part his flesh from ev'ry limb.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The knight in green said, Mr. J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <l>There's nothing else but flesh your due,</l>
                  <l>Then see no drop of blood you shed,</l>
                  <l>For if you do off goes your head,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Pray take your due with all my heart,</l>
                  <l>But with his blood we will not part.</l>
                  <l>With that the Jew sneaked away,</l>
                  <l>And had not one word more to say.</l>

                  <l>NO sooner were these troubles past,</l>
                  <l>But his wife's father came at last,</l>
                  <l>Resolving for to have his life.</l>
                  <l>For drowning his beloved wife.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Over the seas her father brought</l>
                  <l>Many brave horses: One was bought</l>
                  <l>By the pretended knight in green.</l>
                  <l>Which was the best that e're was seen.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>So to the German court he came,</l>
                  <l>Declaring such a one by name,</l>
                  <l>Had drowned his fair daughter dear,</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>They brought him from the prison then,</l>
